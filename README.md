## ⚙️ Part II: Web Service Paradigms & Implementation

### Chapter 3: The REST Architectural Style
- **3.1 What is REST? (Representational State Transfer)**
  - Roy Fielding's Doctoral Dissertation.
  - REST as an architectural style, not a protocol.
- **3.2 The Six Constraints of REST**
  - Client-Server, Stateless, Cacheable, Uniform Interface, Layered System, Code-on-Demand.
- **3.3 RESTful Principles in Practice**
  - Resources and URIs (Noun-based, not verbs).
  - HTTP Methods as Actions (CRUD operations).
  - Representations (JSON, XML).
  - HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) - Advanced Concept.
- **3.4 Designing a RESTful API**
  - Best practices for URI design.
  - Versioning strategies (URI, Headers).
  - Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination.

### Chapter 4: Alternative Service Paradigms
- **4.1 SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Web Services**
  - XML-based protocol.
  - WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for service contract.
  - UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) - The service registry.
  - WS-* Standards stack.
- **4.2 GraphQL**
  - Introduction: A query language for your API.
  - Key Concepts: Schema, Types, Queries, Mutations.
  - Advantages over REST: Efficient data fetching, no over-fetching/under-fetching.
- **4.3 gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**
  - High-performance, uses HTTP/2.
  - Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as interface definition and message format.
  - Use cases: Microservices, mobile clients, low-latency systems.

## 🔐 Part III: Core Security Fundamentals

### Chapter 5: Authentication & Authorization
- **5.1 The Difference: Authentication (AuthN) vs. Authorization (AuthZ)**
- **5.2 Traditional Session-Based Authentication**
  - Cookies and Server-Side Sessions.
- **5.3 Token-Based Authentication**
  - **5.3.1 JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
    - JWT Structure (Header.Payload.Signature).
    - How signing and verification work.
    - Security considerations (Don't store sensitive data, short expiration).
  - **5.3.2 OAuth 2.0 Framework**
    - Roles: Resource Owner, Client, Authorization Server, Resource Server.
    - Grant Types: Authorization Code, Implicit, Client Credentials, Resource Owner Password Credentials.
    - The OAuth Flow Step-by-Step.
  - **5.3.3 OpenID Connect (OIDC)**
    - An identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0.
    - Provides authentication (ID Token) whereas OAuth provides authorization.
- **5.4 API Keys**
  - Simple but less secure. Usage for project/consumer identification.

### Chapter 6: Fundamental Web Security Threats (OWASP Top 10 Focus)
- **6.1 Injection Attacks**
  - SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, Command Injection.
- **6.2 Broken Authentication**
  - Credential stuffing, weak session management.
- **6.3 Sensitive Data Exposure**
  - Lack of encryption in transit and at rest.
- **6.4 XML External Entities (XXE)**
  - Exploiting XML processors.
- **6.5 Broken Access Control**
  - IDOR, privilege escalation.
- **6.6 Security Misconfiguration**
  - Unnecessary services, default accounts, verbose error messages.
- **6.7 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - Relevance to web service consumers.
- **6.8 Insecure Deserialization**
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE) via manipulated objects.
